# WorldeAI-V1
This is a python script of a Wordle game (backend only). It then implements an AI Class that attempts to guess and beat the user at the Wordle using the same word based on some basic OOP logic.

The code utilises python inbuilt funcitons such as file input (to read from the five letter word list) and OOP to demonstrates how we can use classes for simple game development. 

I will be uploading in the future another AI Wordle code that will be able to beat the user without needing the five letter word list already imported into it, this would integrate some basic ML capabilities
